# 2025 BCN AI Tutorial

## Building AI Applications in the Enterprise

Building AI applications for the enterprise requires understanding key architectural patterns that enable powerful, scalable, and intelligent solutions. This session explores the core approaches to building AI-driven applications, including Generative AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and AI Agents.

We’ll dive into how to build and integrate AI apps, discover and connect them with enterprise tools, and manage authentication and authorization securely. Additionally, we’ll cover best practices for deploying AI-powered applications and how an AI Gateway can help monitor, secure, and optimize interactions between AI models, agents, and enterprise systems.

Attendees will gain insights on:
- Key AI patterns: AI Integrations, RAG, and AI Agents.
- Building AI Agents, including tool integration.
- Exposing your Business APIs as tools for your agents.
- Managing authentication and authorization for tools and agents.
- Deploying AI applications and ensuring enterprise readiness.
- The role of an AI Gateway in securing, monitoring, and optimizing AI interactions.
- Best practices for scaling AI applications efficiently.

### Hands-On: Understanding Key AI Patterns

#### Prerequisites

1) Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2) Set up [Ballerina Integrator](https://wso2.github.io/docs-bi/get-started/quick-start-guide/)
3) Open [WSO2Con Assistant](/wso2con_chat_assistant/) using Ballerina Integrator

During this session, we will walk through practical examples showcasing the three key AI patterns:

- AI Integrations – Seamlessly connect AI models with enterprise systems.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) – Enhance AI responses with real-time, domain-specific knowledge.
- AI Agents – Automate workflows by enabling AI to interact with business tools and APIs.

By the end of this session, you’ll gain hands-on experience in building enterprise-grade AI applications and understand how these patterns can drive real business value.
